Omeka Bootstrap
===============

Omeka theme based on the popular [Twitter Bootstrap front-end framework](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

**NB: The master branch of this in-development theme is now Omeka 2.0 compatible. Previous development for Omeka 1.5 is available in branch and tag form.**

This theme is being developed for (and alongside) the [Crowd-Ed plugin](http://github.com/gsbodine/crowd-ed).
Please [see the project wiki for updates](https://github.com/gsbodine/omeka-bootstrap/wiki/Omeka-Bootstrap).

Work has just begun on making a more genericized version based on Bootstrap 3.0.0. The original outcome of this theme (based on 2.3.2 is viewable on the [Martha Berry Digital Archive site](https://mbda.berry.edu).)
