Omeka Bootstrap
===============

An Omeka theme based on the popular [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) front-end framework.

This theme was originally developed for (and alongside) the [Crowd-Ed plugin](http://github.com/gsbodine/crowd-ed).

The original outcome of this theme (based on Bootstrap 2.3.2 and running on Omeka 2.0.x) is viewable on the [Martha Berry Digital Archive](https://mbda.berry.edu) site.

Work has just begun on making a more genericized version based on Bootstrap 3.0.0.
