Wearing Gay History Omeka Bootstrap Theme
===============

An Omeka theme based on the popular [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) front-end framework.

This theme was cloned from Daniel Berthereau's [version](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/omeka-bootstrap) of Omeka-Bootstrap and Gerald Bodine's [Bootstrap theme](https://github.com/gsbodine/omeka-bootstrap) which was originally developed for the [Martha Berry Digital Archive](https://mbda.berry.edu) site.

This theme was moved to Bootstrap 3.3.1 and incorporates the [Codrops Animated Responsive Image Grid](https://github.com/codrops/AnimatedResponsiveImageGrid) on the homepage. The theme was created for use on the [Wearing Gay History Digital Archive](http://www.wearinggayhistory.com).
